# priestess-database
A WPF rendition of a certain gacha database WIP, and an idea from a certain conversation. 
Mostly just for education and practice for using WPF for the first time

Todo list:
- Currenttly, the branch won't work with other computers, since I haven't adapted it use it's local resources.
- Fix the visual glitches with the picture boxes for some units.
- Provide a means to update the images.
- Add more label context for some images.
